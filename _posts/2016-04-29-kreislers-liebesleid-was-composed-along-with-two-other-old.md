Kreisler's Liebesleid was composed along with two other "Old Viennese Dances" - Liebesfreud and Schön Rosmarin. These three pieces have been the staple diet of violinists since they were composed in 1910\. Originally Kreisler published these three Dances as arrangements of pieces by Josef Lanner (1801 --- 1843) but confessed to being the composer of these works after a reviewer told him off for playing some of his own works alongside "these pearls composed by Lanner".

Here is an arrangement of Liebesleid for violin and string orchestra. I've added a little for bar introduction to "set the mood" but it can be omitted!
