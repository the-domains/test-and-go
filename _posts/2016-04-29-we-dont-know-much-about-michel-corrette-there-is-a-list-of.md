Corrette composed 25 Concerto Comiques based on popular tunes of the day. He arranged these tunes for three melody instruments and continuo. The version of his Concerto No.17 is for three violins and continuo. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/49e8606e-f807-47fd-8f94-7e1fb89abcfc.jpg)

I've corrected as many of the errors in the score as I could find and tidied up some of the articulation and slurs.
